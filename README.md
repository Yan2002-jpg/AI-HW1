Judgment by Algorithm: Exploring AI Fairness in Criminal Justice
Analyze the demographic profiles of three counties: Evaluate and visualize the demographic characteristics (race, gender, and education) for each county using pivot tables (Excel) or Pandas (Python).
Deliverable: A summary of demographic data visualized through pie or bar charts, including a comparison of racial and gender distributions across the three counties.
Evaluate risk scores across demographic groups: Analyze the distribution of risk scores by race and gender within each county.
Deliverable: A summary table showing average risk scores for each demographic group, with accompanying visualizations (e.g., bar charts). Include an analysis of how risk scores vary across the counties and demographic groups.
Compare judges’ bail decisions to AI risk scores: Investigate the alignment between judges’ bail decisions and AI-generated risk scores across different racial and gender groups.
Deliverable: Cross-tabulate risk scores and judges’ decisions (e.g., using stacked bar charts) to evaluate consistency. Discuss any patterns of bias in decision-making, highlighting discrepancies between groups.
Analyze re-offense rates and fairness metrics: Calculate re-offense rates and key fairness metrics, including False Positive Rate (FPR) and False Negative Rate (FNR), for each racial group.
Deliverable: Bar charts comparing FPR and FNR across racial groups, accompanied by an interpretation of any disparities observed.
